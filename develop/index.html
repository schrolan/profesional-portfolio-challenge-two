                <p class="centered">As of right now I am still in the introductory weeks of my classes on becoming a developer. I am not sure which area interests me the most, but I cannot wait to learn more. I have already learned so much. I first gained an interest in coding when I made my own games in the games creation system video game Dreams on the playstation 4. Since then my desire to create even more than just games has been expanding. I am more than excited to see what the future holds and to see endless possibilities coding will lead me to.</p>
